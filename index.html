                <p><strong>Benefits:</strong> The guava tree (Psidium guajava) is highly valued for its health benefits, with both the fruit and leaves used in traditional medicine. Guava fruit is rich in vitamin C, potassium, fiber, and antioxidants, which support immunity, digestion, and heart health. The leaves are often brewed into tea for their anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial properties, which may help manage blood sugar levels, improve skin health, and reduce the risk of chronic diseases. Guava is also low in calories, making it an excellent dietary choice for weight management while delivering essential nutrients and promoting general well-being.</p>

                <p><strong>Season:</strong> Guava trees are tropical and subtropical plants that fruit in multiple cycles per year, often during two major seasons: the rainy season (July to September) and the winter season (November to March). However, the specific fruiting season varies depending on the region and local climate. In warm climates, guava trees can produce fruit year-round. Farmers may even encourage off-season fruiting through pruning and irrigation techniques, making guava a versatile crop that remains accessible in various seasons and conditions.</p>

                <p><strong>Region:</strong> Native to Central and South America, the guava tree has become widely cultivated in tropical and subtropical regions worldwide. It is a resilient plant, thriving in regions such as India, Brazil, Mexico, the Caribbean, Southeast Asia, and parts of Africa and the United States. Guava trees adapt well to different soil types and climates, making them popular in countries with warm weather. In India, guava is especially abundant, growing in states like Maharashtra, Uttar Pradesh, and Tamil Nadu, where it has become an essential part of both diet and economy.</p>

                <p><strong>Age:</strong> Guava trees grow quickly and can start bearing fruit as early as 2-4 years after planting. With proper care, a guava tree remains productive for up to 40 years, although most commercial orchards replace them after 15-20 years to maintain high-quality yield. The tree grows to an average height of 3-10 meters and, in favorable conditions, can reach its peak fruit production within 5-8 years. Regular pruning and maintenance contribute to a longer lifespan and sustained fruit-bearing capacity, making guava trees a lasting and fruitful addition to orchards and gardens.</p>
